     Name:       Ice Shard                        
     Resolution: True-Color                       
                                                  
                                                  
   INSTALATION:                                   
                                                  
   To use these cursors, you must unzip the       
   IceShardCur.zip file into it's own directory.  
                                                  
   If you would like to further install the       
   scheme for ease of use, you can run the        
   IceShardCur.inf by right-clicking on the file  
   and selecting Install.  This will copy the     
   cursors to the \CURSORS\ICESHARD directory     
   under your system directory and install the    
   Scheme in the registry. Next, go to the        
   Control Panel (found under Settings in the     
   Start Menu) and doubleclick on the "Mouse"     
   icon.  Once that's opened, click on the        
   "Pointers" tab.  From there you should be      
   able to select the Ice Shard scheme.  Enjoy!
