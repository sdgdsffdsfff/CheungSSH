   SCHEME INFO:

           Name: Metal Oxide
     Resolution: 256 Colors


   INSTALATION:

   To use these cursors, you must unzip the
   MetalOxideCur.zip file into it's own
   directory.

   If you would like to further install the       
   scheme for ease of use, you can run the        
   'Metal Oxide.inf' installation by right-
   clicking on the file and selecting Install.
   This will copy the cursors to the
   \CURSORS\MetalOxide directory under your
   system directory and install the scheme in
   the registry. Next, go to the Control Panel
   (found under Settings in the Start Menu)
   and doubleclick on the "Mouse" icon.  Once
   that's opened, click on the "Pointers" tab.
   From there you should be able to select
   the Metal Oxide scheme.  Enjoy!
